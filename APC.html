    <p>I started my job at APC at the end of May 2022 under the caliber training program as its the natural flow for
        career
        starting at APC, although from day one I was enrolled in the instrument team at the cold crystallization plants
        and
        since then I participate in multiple projects in all phases such as initiating, planning, execution supervision
        &
        commissioning in addition to the routine preventive maintenance works, emergency maintenance request s and
        annual plants shutdown.

    <ul>
        <li>
            Developed two new protection systems for the existing container filling system. As a result, we
            significantly reduced downtime and minimized damage to parts, <b>leading to an impressive 50%
                reduction in maintenance and spare part costs</b></li>
        <li>
            Consolidated with multiple departments to establish the project scope, objectives, and deliverables
            for the container filling upgrade. As a result, <b>we achieved a 75% reduction in system downtime
                and nearly 25% improvement in efficiency.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            Supervised the entire commissioning phase for the Packaging project. After testing, fine-tuning,
            and optimization, my team and I successfully achieved our project goals. One line now produces
            <b>60 one-ton bags per hour</b>, while the other line exceeds expectations by producing <b>over 1000 25kg
                bags per hour.
            </b>
        </li>
        <li>
            maintaining, implementing, and improving electrical instruments for industrial purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Orchestrated strategic planning initiatives for upcoming major events, optimizing production
            operations which led to a record-breaking production year achieving <b>2684 tons in 2022</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Performed control valve maintenance, replacement, and selection <b>Leading to reduce downtime by
                at least 8% </b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            contribute to annual plant shutdowns. Planning requires about four weeks of preparation, and
            during the shutdowns, we <b>extend working hours by 75%</b> requiring effective labor management to
            prevent workplace accidents.
